# GeneticAlgorithmForTSP

Simple genetic algorithm for Traveling Salesman Problem. The code implements population managment, tournament selection, crossover of individuals and mutation. There's simple graphical presentation of the results as well as the basic parameters that allows to control the algorithm throught the entire optimization process... Feel free to modify the parameters and experiments with your own data :)
